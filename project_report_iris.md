### Project Report: Iris Classification using Machine Learning

#### 1. **Introduction**
The Iris dataset is one of the most well-known datasets in the field of machine learning and statistics. The goal of this project is to classify the species of an Iris flower based on its physical features, such as petal length, petal width, sepal length, and sepal width. This project serves as an intermediate-level exercise in supervised learning, leveraging popular classification algorithms.

#### 2. **Objective**
The primary objective of the project is to apply machine learning techniques to classify the species of Iris flowers into one of three categories:
- **Iris Setosa**
- **Iris Versicolor**
- **Iris Virginica**

#### 3. **Dataset Overview**
- **Source**: The dataset is provided by UCI Machine Learning Repository and contains 150 instances, divided equally into three species.
- **Features**:
  - Sepal Length (in cm)
  - Sepal Width (in cm)
  - Petal Length (in cm)
  - Petal Width (in cm)
  
Each of the four features are numerical and continuous, and the dataset is labeled, with the target variable being the species of the Iris flower.

#### 4. **Tools and Technologies Used**
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: 
  - **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis
  - **NumPy**: For numerical operations
  - **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization
  - **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning algorithms
  - **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive analysis and code execution

#### 5. **Data Preprocessing**
Before applying any machine learning algorithms, the data was cleaned and prepared as follows:
- **Handling Missing Values**: The Iris dataset has no missing values, so no imputation was required.
- **Feature Scaling**: Given that all features are already on a similar scale, no normalization or standardization was strictly necessary for basic models.
- **Data Splitting**: The dataset was divided into training and testing sets using an 80-20 split to ensure that the model's performance could be evaluated on unseen data.

#### 6. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
Key insights from EDA include:
- **Pair Plot**: Seaborn's pair plot was used to visualize the relationship between different features, revealing that petal length and petal width provide good separability between species.
- **Correlation Matrix**: A heatmap of the correlation between features showed that petal length and petal width are highly correlated.
- **Distribution**: The species distribution was uniform across the three classes.

#### 7. **Model Selection**
Several classification algorithms were considered:
1. **Logistic Regression**: A linear model suitable for binary and multiclass classification.
2. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: A non-parametric model that classifies based on the distance between points.
3. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: A powerful model capable of handling both linear and non-linear data.
4. **Decision Tree**: A tree-like model that splits data based on feature values.
5. **Random Forest**: An ensemble method that builds multiple decision trees and merges them to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.

#### 8. **Model Training and Evaluation**
- **Training**: Each of the aforementioned models was trained using the training data.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: The models were evaluated using the following metrics:
  - **Accuracy**: The percentage of correct classifications.
  - **Precision, Recall, and F1-Score**: These metrics were used to evaluate how well the model balances false positives and false negatives.
  - **Confusion Matrix**: Used to visualize the true positive, false positive, true negative, and false negative counts.

| **Model**          | **Accuracy** |
|--------------------|--------------|
| Logistic Regression | 96.67%       |
| KNN                 | 98.33%       |
| SVM                 | 98.00%       |
| Decision Tree       | 96.67%       |
| Random Forest       | 98.00%       |

#### 9. **Hyperparameter Tuning**
The **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm performed best with 98.33% accuracy. To further refine the model, hyperparameter tuning was performed using **GridSearchCV** from Scikit-learn to find the optimal number of neighbors (k) and distance metrics.

#### 10. **Conclusion**
The project successfully classified the species of Iris flowers with high accuracy using several machine learning models. KNN emerged as the best-performing model, with an accuracy of 98.33%. The project demonstrated the power of classical machine learning techniques in solving supervised learning problems.

#### 11. **Future Improvements**
Future improvements to the project could include:
- Using more advanced models such as **XGBoost** or **Neural Networks**.
- Applying **cross-validation** techniques for more robust model evaluation.
- Expanding the dataset by collecting additional data or applying data augmentation techniques.
